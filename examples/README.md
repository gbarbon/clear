## CLEAR framework

Examples usage
--------------

The directory `examples` contains some examples to evaluate our tool. 
You can :

   1. produce the Counterexample LTS  
   2. discover neighbourhoods in the Counterexample LTS with the CLEAR Analyser
   3. Visualize the Counterexample LTS and neighbourhoods with CLEAR Visualizer

You can directly jump to points 2 or 3, the necessary files are already 
available for all the three steps.

**NOTE:** *in order to generate the Counterexample LTS the CLEAR analyser exploits 
a feature of the CADP toolbox that is not yet publicly available, but will be 
released in a future CADP release. Anyway the neighbourhood detection and the
visualisation can anyway be performed, since the necessary files are all 
available in each example directory.*
