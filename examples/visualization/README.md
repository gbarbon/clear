## CLEAR framework

Examples usage
--------------

The current folder contains some examples to evaluate our tool,
in particular the CLEAR Visualizer. 
You can :

   1. Produce the Counterexample LTS. 
   2. Discover neighbourhoods in the Counterexample LTS with the CLEAR Analyser.
   3. Visualize the Counterexample LTS and neighbourhoods with CLEAR Visualizer.

You can directly jump to points 2 or 3, the necessary files are already 
available for all the three steps.

**NOTE:** *in order to generate the Counterexample LTS the CLEAR analyser 
exploits some private features of the CADP toolbox, which will be made publicly available in a future CADP release. 
The neighbourhood detection and the visualization can be performed 
without the need to produce the Counterexample LTS, since the necessary files 
have already been computed and are available in each example directory.*
